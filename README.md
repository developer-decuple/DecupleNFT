Decuple NFT project specifications and information.



The Decuple project is built on four interconnected smart contracts:

Decuple BEP-721: This is the main contract for managing and minting NFTs (unique digital assets) within the Decuple ecosystem.
Agent Contract: This contract acts as a manager, handling payments and overseeing the NFT minting process.
Bonus Contract: This contract tracks referrals and distributes rewards in the form of DCO tokens to users who refer others and potentially mint NFTs themselves.
DCO BEP-20: This is the Decuple project's native token (DCO). It's used for various purposes within the ecosystem, including paying referral rewards and potentially distributing airdrops.
